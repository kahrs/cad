A description of the files used by espectro:

elaborate.c
	This walks the parse tree and instantiates instances and calls models.
	All the hard work is done here.
lex.c
	Lexical analyzer --- the usual expression of a FSM
matrix.c
	Matrix routines to construct the nodal matrices needed by the PWL analysis.
reader.c
	Interface routines to be called by any clients of espectro
sym.c
	Symbol table stuff
commands.c
	Stubs for various commands in Espectro.  Maybe some year.
espectro.c
	Standalone interface
evaluate.c
	Expression evaluator for the parse tree.  Nothing startling.
library.c
	An experimental version of a external library model.  Use this as a template
	for a dynamically loaded model.
models.c
	Builtin models.
semantics.c
	Semantic routines called by the parser
test.c
	Brutally simple test
