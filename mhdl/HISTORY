25 December 1993
	This marks the zeroth release of the MHDL front-end.  It has a number
	of bugs and does not implement a typed symbol table.  However, it
	has been ported to three different operating systems (Sun, SGI
	and Plan9) and compiles under gcc and lcc.  Operating system specific
	code is hopefully very limited (see syntax error reporting).
	There are two Makefiles, one for Sun and one for everyone else.
	The compile time switch BACKTRACE permits a readable version of
	the parse stack backtrace; this is not available in the non-Sun
	system.

	The release also includes units.mhdl, the units package from Compact
	and Chapter 10 (standard.mhdl).  Both of these parse error free
	in this release.

	Please note that the front-end will change in subsequent releases
	so changes to the semantics (in mhdl.y) should be done with care.

	Fixes a grammar error and also improves the Makefiles to make them
	easier to modify for different versions of yacc and OS.

	26 years later, I am releasing this.  I made it compile with
	more modern C and YACC/Bison but that is the extent of my
	work.  It runs, but there appear to be bugs in the semantics
	routines.  If you'd like more, then please contact me.
