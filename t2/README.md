t2 (pronounced "t square") is a small homage to my architecture father's
drafting table and t square.

It is an interpreter that accepts a small "domain specific language"
and generates IGES, an early card based lifeform.

To release this, I had to update the include files, reason out the
complication of flex vs. lex and bison vs. yacc.

Have fun.
